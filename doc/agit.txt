INTRODUCTION					*agit-introduction*

*agit.vim* is yet another gitk clone plugin for Vim.
You can show repository history and commit details at the same time.
This plugin also provides the following features.

* Executable various git command
* No |fugitive| dependency, but well cooperation if that exists.
* Supporting multibyte character

Latest version:
https://github.com/cohama/agit.vim


==============================================================================
USAGE						*agit-usage*

When you edit a file which in any git repository, type the below
>
	:Agit

and an Agit tab will be opened.
The Agit tab is composed with three windows/buffers. Left windows is
|agit-log|, right above is |agit-stat| and right bellow is |agit-diff|.

						*agit-log*
|agit-log| shows the 'git log' result including branches and tags. You can move
the cursor arbitrarily and this updates |agit-stat| and |agit-diff| buffers
automatically.
Some useful commands such as |<Plug>(agit-git-checkout)|,
|<Plug>(agit-git-reset)| are defined in this buffer.
If you installed |fugitive|, some fugitive commands (e.g. |:Gcommit|,
|:Gstatus|) are also available.

						*agit-stat*
|agit-stat| shows the 'git diff --stat' result. This means that it shows
changed files between the commit under the cursor in |agit-log| buffer and
the previous commit of it.

						*agit-diff*
|agit-diff| shows the 'git diff' result. This is similar to |agit-stat| but it
shows patches.

If you want to exit from agit.vim, press |q| or |:q|.

You can also use |:AgitFile| to trace single file.

	:AgitFile

INTERFACE					*agit-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*agit-commands*

						*:Agit*
:Agit [{options}]
	Open a new Agit tab. Repository path is automatically searched from a
	current buffer path.
	This command can receive some options.

	--dir={basedir}				*agit-option-dir*
	Set the repository path to {basedir}.

						*:Agit!*
:Agit! [{options}]
	Open a new Agit tab. Repository path is based on the current
	directory. This command takes all the options that the `git log`
	command can take.

	It is different from the regular |:Agit| command in
	that it does not use the option `--all` to the `git log` command. So
	it will only show the history based on arguments passed, and not of
	the entire repo. So for example, if no options are paseed, it will
	show the history of the current branch, just like running `git log` in
	your shell would do.

						*:AgitFile*
:AgitFile [{options}]
	Similar to |:Agit| but trace only current file log.
	You can see raw file instead of |agit-stat| and |agit-diff|.

	--file={path}			*agit-option-file*
	Specify the file you want to trace. If omitted, % (current file) is
	used.

						*:AgitGit*
:AgitGit[!] {args}
	Execute the specified git command. This is done in a current git
	repository path.
	Note: This command is available only in |agit-log| buffer.
	Note: This command is similar to |fugitive|'s |:Git| command, but this
	command uses |system()| internally so that the shell is not launched.

	If you specify !, this command uses |:!| instead of |system()|.
	(Same as |fugitive|'s |:Git|)

						*:AgitDiff*
:AgitDiff [{revisions}]
	Show |vimdiff| against the target file.
	AgitDiff accepts target revision(s) as an argument.
	Note: This command is available only in |agit-log| buffer from
	|:AgitFile| and |agit-stat| buffer.

	When launched from |agit-log| buffer, target of |:AgitFile| is treated
	as target file.
	When launched from |agit-stat| buffer, AgitDiff trys to pick target file
	from cursor position. (see |<cfile>|)

	If you installed |fugitive|, AgitDiff uses |fugitive| when showing staged
	file. This means you can stage or unstage each hunks like |:Gdiff|.

						*agit-diff-revspec*
	revisions can be specified by almost same way as "git diff".
	For example:

	:AgitDiff (No revision specified)
	show changes made by current revision

	:AgitDiff REV1
	show changes between REV1 and local

	:AgitDiff REV1..REV2
	show changes between REV1 and REV2

	:AgitDiff REV1...REV2
	show changes between marge_base(REV1, REV2) and REV2
	marge_base(REV1, REV2) means "newest common ancestor of REV1 and REV2"

	:AgitDiff REV1..
	show changes between REV1 and HEAD ("HEAD" can be omitted)
