INTRODUCTION					*agit-introduction*

*agit.vim* is yet another gitk clone plugin for Vim.
You can show repository history and commit details at the same time.
This plugin also provides the following features.

* Executable various git command
* No |fugitive| dependency, but well cooperation if that exists.
* Supporting multibyte character

Latest version:
https://github.com/cohama/agit.vim


==============================================================================
USAGE						*agit-usage*

When you edit a file which in any git repository, type the below
>
	:Agit

and an Agit tab will be opened.
The Agit tab is composed with three windows/buffers. Left windows is
|agit-log|, right above is |agit-stat| and right bellow is |agit-diff|.

						*agit-log*
|agit-log| shows the 'git log' result including branches and tags. You can move
the cursor arbitrarily and this updates |agit-stat| and |agit-diff| buffers
automatically.
Some useful commands such as |<Plug>(agit-git-checkout)|,
|<Plug>(agit-git-reset)| are defined in this buffer.
If you installed |fugitive|, some fugitive commands (e.g. |:Gcommit|,
|:Gstatus|) are also available.

						*agit-stat*
|agit-stat| shows the 'git diff --stat' result. This means that it shows
changed files between the commit under the cursor in |agit-log| buffer and
the previous commit of it.

						*agit-diff*
|agit-diff| shows the 'git diff' result. This is similar to |agit-stat| but it
shows patches.

If you want to exit from agit.vim, press |q| or |:q|.

You can also use |:AgitFile| to trace single file.
>
	:AgitFile

INTERFACE					*agit-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*agit-commands*

						*:Agit*
:Agit [{options}]
	Open a new Agit tab. Repository path is automatically searched from a
	current buffer path.
	This command can receive some options.

	--dir={basedir}				*agit-option-dir*
	Set the repository path to {basedir}.

						*:AgitFile*
:AgitFile [{options}]
	Similar to |:Agit| but trace only current file log.
	You can see raw file instead of |agit-stat| and |agit-diff|.

	--file={path}			*agit-option-file*
	Specify the file you want to trace. If omitted, % (current file) is
	used.

						*:AgitGit*
:AgitGit[!] {args}
	Execute the specified git command. This is done in a current git
	repository path.
	Note: This command is available only in |agit-log| buffer.
	Note: This command is similar to |fugitive|'s |:Git| command, but this
	command uses |system()| internally so that the shell is not launched.

	If you specify !, this command uses |:!| instead of |system()|.
	(Same as |fugitive|'s |:Git|)

						*:AgitDiff*
:AgitDiff [{revisions}]
	Show |vimdiff| against the target file.
	AgitDiff accepts target revision(s) as an argument.
	Note: This command is available only in |agit-log| buffer from
	|:AgitFile| and |agit-stat| buffer.

	When launched from |agit-log| buffer, target of |:AgitFile| is treated
	as target file.
	When launched from |agit-stat| buffer, AgitDiff trys to pick target file
	from cursor position. (see |<cfile>|)

	If you installed |fugitive|, AgitDiff uses |fugitive| when showing staged
	file. This means you can stage or unstage each hunks like |:Gdiff|.

						*agit-diff-revspec*
	revisions can be specified by almost same way as "git diff".
	For example:

	:AgitDiff (No revision specified)
	show changes made by current revision

	:AgitDiff REV1
	show changes between REV1 and local

	:AgitDiff REV1..REV2
	show changes between REV1 and REV2

	:AgitDiff REV1...REV2
	show changes between marge_base(REV1, REV2) and REV2
	marge_base(REV1, REV2) means "newest common ancestor of REV1 and REV2"

	:AgitDiff REV1..
	show changes between REV1 and HEAD ("HEAD" can be omitted)
